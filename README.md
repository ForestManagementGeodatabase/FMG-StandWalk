# FMG-StandWalk 
Creates a Forest Management Geodatabase (FMG) Stand Walk Report. <img src="docs/images/HDQLO-03_h120.jpg" align="right" />

## Description
The purpose of this report is to automate the production of the reports needed by foresters to conduct the "Stand Walk Recon" task. The purpose of a Stand Walk Recon is to assess the current condition of a given forest stand using the forest survey data recorded in the FMG, and from this information, to develop a "Stand Perscription" that will define its management in the coming years. 

The "Stand Walk Recon" task is composed of two elements:
* **Stand Summay** - A sheet summarizing the FMG field survey data for a given stand. Foresters need to consult the summary statistics on this sheet to help record decisions on the next sheet. 
* **Stand Perscription** - A sheet used by a forester to record their assessment of what management actions should be taken for a given stand. 

## Funding
Funding for the development and maintenance of the Forest Management Geodatabase (FMG) has been provided by USACE Rock Island District, Operations Division, Mississippi River Project, Natural Resources.
