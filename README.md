# FMG-StandWalk
Creates a Forest Management Geodatabase (FMG) Stand Walk Report. 

The purpose of this report is to automate the production of the reports needed by foresters to conduct the "Stand Walk Recon" task. The purpose of a Stand Walk Recon is to assess the current condition of a given forest stand using the forest survey data recorded in the FMG, and from this information, to develop a "Stand Perscription" that will define its management in the coming years. 

The "Stand Walk Recon" task is composed of two elements:
* **Stand Summay** - A sheet summarizing the FMG field survey data for a given stand. Foresters need to consult the summary statistics on this sheet to help record decisions on the next sheet. 
* **Stand Perscription** - A sheet used by a forester to record their assessment of what management actions should be taken for a given stand.
